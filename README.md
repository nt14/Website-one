This is the Url of the live website https://nt14.github.io/Website-one/
In this task i learnt how to make a website more accessible. i had to see what errors there were and correct the mistakes that were restricting the website from not working. for example i had to link the images to the right files as it couldn't read it therefore not being able to detact the images and it was showing up as broken on the website.
